			<h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
			<div class="item">
				<p>To obtain a  challenging and meaningful enterprise software development position that will  enable me to utilize my technical, communication and organizational skills.
			</div>
			<p>
				<h3>My main skills are:</h3>
			<div class="item">
			<ul >
                <li>Project Management (5 years)</li>
                <li>Java, J2EE (10+ years)</li>
				<li>Web Applications development (10+ years)</li>
				<li>Application Analysis (10+ years)</li>
				<li>Business analysis (5+ years)</li>
				<li>Application testing (10+ years)</li>
			</ul>

				<font class="fontclass">Project Management:</font><br/>
				<p>I was managing team of consultants 2 on-site and 10 offshore. I had to work with both fixed bid projects (fixed budget) and fixed time projects. I also worked with standard projects to make sure it is completed within budget and on time. I was managing project risks such as availability of additional resources from other dev teams and infrastructure resources. Most of the projects were full SDLC.
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<font class="fontclass">Java/J2EE: </font> <br/>
				<p>Last 8 years I worked with IBM WebSphere environment starting 5.1 and finishing on 8.4. I worked with JMS and enterprise bus, Web Services, JDBC and other related technologies.
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<font class="fontclass">Web applications: </font> <br/>
				<p>I designed and implemented web applications using Struts, JSP, HTML, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, Ajax and JSON. Web application were designed using SOA architecture enabling tier and object separation and generalization. I used 3 tier approach with UI as tier 1, Java/J2EE back end as tier 2 and Database (Oracle, IBM iSeries DB2) as tier 3. All tiers were designed to be independent from each other using interfaces.
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<font class="fontclass">Application analysis: </font> <br/>
				<p>If I am responsible for developing and application or at least for creating a solution, then I always tries to implement logging mechanism in all tiers of the application. This logging mechanism would on/off mechanism not to slow production version of app.
					Analyzing application that I know nothing off is usually involved going thru source code, testing UI to understand app functionality, creating data flow diagram, process flowchart and etc. it helps if some tools are available to simplify app analysis.
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<font class="fontclass">Business Analysis: </font> <br/>
				<p>I closely worked with business users of our web applications to help them solve business problems and increase their productivity. Sometimes suggesting a solution I was able to see in their area or request coming from business users it all started with business requirements. I am very good at getting to the bottom of the problem and creating requirements for dev team to implement. I also work with different business or technical teams to create full solution. I do a good job of communicating statuses to both business users and IT managers and stakeholders.
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<font class="fontclass">Application testing: </font> <br/>
				<p>I was involved in different types of testing the application including the systems of applications were part of. I did Unit testing, UI testing, UAT testing with business users, integration testing of all components of the system and data flow testing.
