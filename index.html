							<p> Since the young age I have always been into cross dressing. That was also my biggest secret because I grew up in the environment where such things were unacceptable. I was also afraid of rejection if person I am with would find out my secret. Every time I've started a relationship the thought of her finding out and rejecting me was pushing me into state where I wasn't honest with her. She felt that I am hiding something and slowly things start to break also because I was not completely with her but in my own closet. I met few good women, but always the relationship ended in few month or weeks all because I've been hiding in my closet. In 2009 I've decided to be honest with new woman and tell her my secret... surprisingly it went a lot better then I expected and she was fine with my desires for cross dressing. Everything went good and in 3 months she became pregnant and we were happy about it. 3 months into the pregnancy she suddenly decides that she is not fine with my cross dressing and left me. I was begging her to come back but it was all for nothing. I became so angry that I decided that since this desire is causing me so much trouble all my life I must go out of the closet and try to live openly as a woman... I thought that since I love to wear womenâ€™s clothes I must be a woman inside trapped in the mans body. In 2011 I openly went to work dressed as a woman. With help of some psychologists of course. 5 years I lived as a woman, taking hormones, but being alone since I made it in my mind that nobody would be friends with or date somebody like me. Finally I came to realize that I am not a woman, I am male to the bone. It's just a cross dressing nothing more. Since I've been in isolation for so long it's difficult to get back on track with depression in my head. But I will continue to fight through this depression and go back to be able to live full life.
