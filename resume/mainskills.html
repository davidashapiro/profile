					<h2>Project Management:</h2>
					<p>I was managing team of consultants 2 on-site and 10 offshore. I had to work with both fixed bid projects (fixed budget) and fixed time projects. I also worked with standard projects to make sure it is completed within budget and on time. I was managing project risks such as availability of additional resources from other dev teams and infrastructure resources. Most of the projects were full SDLC.

				<div class="item">
					<h2>Web applications: </h2>
					<p>I designed and implemented web applications using Struts, JSP, HTML, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, Ajax and JSON. Web application were designed using SOA architecture enabling tier and object separation and generalization. I used 3 tier approach with UI as tier 1, Java/J2EE back end as tier 2 and Database (Oracle, IBM iSeries DB2) as tier 3. All tiers were designed to be independent from each other using interfaces.

					<h2>Application analysis: </h2>
					<p>If I am responsible for developing and application or at least for creating a solution, then I always tries to implement logging mechanism in all tiers of the application. This logging mechanism would on/off mechanism not to slow production version of app. Analyzing application that I know nothing off is usually involved going thru source code, testing UI to understand app functionality, creating data flow diagram, process flowchart and etc. it helps if some tools are available to simplify app analysis.

					<h2>Business Analysis: </h2> 
					<p>I closely worked with business users of our web applications to help them solve business problems and increase their productivity. Sometimes suggesting a solution I was able to see in their area or request coming from business users it all started with business requirements. I am very good at getting to the bottom of the problem and creating requirements for dev team to implement. I also work with different business or technical teams to create full solution. I do a good job of communicating statuses to both business users and IT managers and stakeholders.
